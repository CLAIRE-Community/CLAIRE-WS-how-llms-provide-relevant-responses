### üõ†Ô∏è **Workshop Overview:**
- **Topic**: How Large Language Models Provide Relevant Responses
- **Objective**: Explore the core concepts behind LLMs and understand how they generate contextually relevant outputs based on user inputs.

#### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **Introduction to LLMs**: 
   - Understand the basics of Large Language Models and their transformative impact across industries such as healthcare, customer service, and more.
   
2. **Tokenization**:
   - Learn how LLMs break down language into tokens, allowing the models to process and interpret text meaningfully.

3. **Contextual Embeddings**:
   - Explore how models use embeddings to represent words numerically, capturing their context and meaning for more accurate responses.

4. **Transformer Architecture**:
   - Delve into the core structure of Transformers, which enables LLMs to attend to relevant parts of input text through attention mechanisms.

5. **Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks**:
   - Discover how LLMs can be fine-tuned for specialized tasks such as sentiment analysis, document summarization, and more.

6. **Ethics and Bias**:
   - Discuss the ethical implications and biases inherent in LLMs, and explore best practices for deploying these models responsibly.
